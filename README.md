## Description
This project is a user-friendly graphical interface for hashing passwords using algorithms like SHA-256, and MD5. Built with Java Swing, the application provides options to input a password, choose a hashing algorithm, and view the hashed result. It also includes helpful features such as clearing inputs and displaying additional information (e.g., Help and Credits).

## Features
Password Hashing: Hash passwords using various algorithms.

Interactive GUI: Select hashing algorithms via a menu bar and perform actions with buttons.

Help Menu: Provides detailed guidance on how to use the application.

Credit Section: Displays the author's credit details.

Clear Functionality: Easily reset input and output fields.

## How to Use
Enter a password in the input text field.

Choose a hashing algorithm from the "Algorithms" menu.

Click the CONVERT button to generate a placeholder hashed value.

Clear the fields using the CLEAR button if needed.

For guidance, visit the Help section in the menu bar.

## Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later installed.

## Libraries/Packages Used
javax.swing: For creating the graphical user interface.

java.awt: For layout management and user interface elements.

java.security: For implementing hashing functionality

## Future Improvements
Add more hashing algorithms such as the rest of the SHA-2 family, etc..
